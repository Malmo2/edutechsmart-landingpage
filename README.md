## Re-creating EduTechSmart
This project is about re-creating the EduTechSmart website with different ideas and styling.

## Pitch
Our mission: make EduTechSmart’s landing page feel like 2025, not 2012. Clean design, mobile-first, and dark mode—because nobody likes being blinded at midnight.

## Design 

- Minimalist Layout – Focus on clarity and readability with plenty of whitespace.

- Mobile-First Approach – Designed for small screens first, then scaled up for tablets and desktops.

- Dark Mode Friendly – Built-in dark mode toggle for modern usability and reduced eye strain.

- Consistent Color Palette – Chosen to reflect professionalism while staying fresh and modern.

- Typography Hierarchy – Clean, modern fonts with clear headings and body text for easy scanning.

- Interactive Elements – Subtle hover effects, animations, and transitions to improve engagement.

- Accessibility – High-contrast text, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML for inclusivity.

- Grid-Based Layout – Sections structured with CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsiveness and alignment.

- Reusable Components – Buttons, cards, and navbars designed for consistency across the site.

- Modern Hero Section – Bold headline, clear call-to-action button, and responsive background image/video.
